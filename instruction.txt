Coding challenge Python/Search Engineer

This is the small project we'd like you to complete. You can send us the result either over email or via Github (or similar tools).
 
Task: Create a HTTP REST service that is able to store, retrieve and search
natural language documents. Search API should support a free text search
parameter, where a user is able to retrieve documents matching their query,
similar to what google search does.
Bonus task would be to use a LLM to directly generate the answer to the user query, instead of returning the matching results list.
 
An example request for the service would be. Below is just a very simple example but use the REST best practices. E.g. --> Data can be sent in via request body also.:
 
  POST / HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/json
  Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 
  text=This+is+a+long+text
 
This endpoint should return a document_id which can be used later to retrieve
the document again.
 
A second endpoint should return the search result list where the top K documents
matching the results are returned in a sorted order (with a sorting criteria of
your choosing). We leave the specification of this API endpoint for you to decide.
 
You can choose the web-framework of your choice in python for this task. We recommend fastAPI, Flask.
For powering the search experience, we recommend to use Elasticsearch
or any other similar tool of your liking.
 
Please provide instructions on how to start and use your web application.
 
Please make sure to include some code or thoughts on testing of this code.
